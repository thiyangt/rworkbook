Let \\(f_X(x)\\) and \\(F_X(x)\\) denote the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of \\(X\\) respectively. Write R codes to find \\(f_X(4)\\) \\(F_X(4)\\) \\(F_X^{-1}(0.5)\\) Let \\(X \\sim Binomial(6, 0.5)\\). Write R codes to calculate the followings: \\(P(X=3)\\) \\(P(X \\geq 3)\\) \\(P(X \\leq 1)\\) Write R codes to visualize the probability mass function of \\(Y \\sim Binomial(6, 0.2)\\). 4.3 Matrix calculations The matrices \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are defined as follows \\[ P = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 8\\\\ 7 &amp; 6 &amp; 5 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 \\\\ 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 7\\\\ 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 5 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Write R codes to solve the following problems: Find the determinant of the matrix \\(P\\). Find the transpose of the matrix \\(P\\). Find the inverse of the matrix \\(P\\). \\({P&#39;P}^{-1}\\) \\(P + Q\\) \\(P - Q\\) \\(P \\times Q\\) Write R codes to solve the following problems: Generate a random sample of size 1000 from the \\(Uniform(0, 5)\\) store in a vector called sample.unif. Find the number of values greater than 2.5 in the vector sample.unif. Construct a 100x10 matrix to store the values in the vector sample.unif. Calculate and store the mean and median of each column of the matrix. "]]
